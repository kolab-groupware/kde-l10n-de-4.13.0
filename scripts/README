This directory contains scripts, which are needed at runtime to provide 
a correct german translation.
One example for a runtime-depency is the fuzzy clock applet, where some 
translations for the time-strings are beeing computed at runtime using 
these scripts.

DISTRIBUTORS: PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO PACKAGE AND INSTALL THESE SCRIPTS!
